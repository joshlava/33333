This project contains two main functions,
AI program that plays the game Threes as well as playable GUI version of the game
To run AI navigate to the Run directory in a terminal window and execute java -jar Ai.jar
it will then prompt for an input text file, we include 4 input files in our Run directory,
exampleinput.txt 
exampleinputsmall.txt
evan
and ridge 
you can choose any of these or choose any file that abides by the format specified in the project specification http://undergraduate.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS3001/project/


The program will then run and print the final game score as well as printing to an output file out.txt (also in this directory)\

To run the GUI you must follow the same process, however execute java -jar Threes.jar
and specify input files.
